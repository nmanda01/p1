<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Nikhil Manda.  I’m a rising senior at the University of Texas. My major is in Computer Science, and my minor is in economics.  I am in Boston for an internship this summer. I am aspiring to work in the blooming field of data analytics. </p>

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>

<p>I’ve taken quite a few courses in Computer Science for my undergraduate degree, but I have not had the chance to specifically learn web development until now.  Also, as mentioned earlier, I am visiting Boston this summer for an internship.  I thought this would be a great opportunity to take advantage of Harvard Summer School.  </p>

<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
<p>I learned HTML as early as when I was in elementary school, because It was really from that age I was really curious how websites were built, and looked for resource to learn this.  I also took a course in web design when I was in high school, as part of my technology requirement for high school graduation, where I learned HTML and CSS more extensively.  It has been a while though, so I have been brushing up.  </p>

<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>As stated earlier, I am a Computer Science major, so object oriented programming is my bread and butter.  I’ve done several school projects in Java specifically.  I’ve also learned SQL in my Database Systems class.  
</p>

<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>

<p>A little bit.  I attended a “hackathon” this last spring semester at AT&T, where we were given an extensive project to complete in a few hours.  Part of it required developing a website in PHP, which I had to learn on the spot with a group member.  I would not however call myself proficient in PHP.  
</p>

<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>I am on a Mac.</p>

<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>No, I think I have covered everything in the aforementioned questions.  </p>
